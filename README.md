**PhonePe Clone Project**
This PhonePe Clone is a front-end implementation of a UPI payment app landing page, inspired by PhonePe's official website. Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, the project features a responsive and visually engaging layout, including animation effects using AOS and a dark mode toggle for user customization. It includes smooth scrolling, interactive buttons, and a testimonial carousel to simulate real-world website behavior.

The design leverages modern front-end libraries such as Ionicons for vector icons and AOS for scroll-based animations, enhancing user experience. The site provides a comprehensive introduction to the app's features, including download buttons for Google Play and the Apple App Store.

Responsive Navigation Bar – A sticky navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes and includes smooth scrolling links.
Hero Section – Includes app download buttons for Google Play and Apple Store, with animated ion icons and an iPhone mockup.
Feature Boxes – Highlights key functionalities of the PhonePe app, such as bill payments, money transfers, and shopping.
Testimonial Carousel – A rotating carousel featuring testimonials from notable organizations and public figures, using Bootstrap's carousel component.
Contact Section – A functional contact form where users can reach out with their queries.
Dark Mode Toggle – Users can switch between light and dark mode dynamically, ensuring a more accessible design.
